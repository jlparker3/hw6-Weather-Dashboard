## Purpose of Application
The purpose of the application allows the user to input a city of their choice into the search box and when the search button is clicked, it will result in a detailed forecast and a 5 day forecast of said city. 



## My Experience
I enjoyed this homework after thinking through the logic and taking it apart step by step.It was challenging, I did get the application to function properly. With more time I would clean up the presenting css.


## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
